A person standing alone at the edge of a tall building rooftop, overlooking a modern city skyline covered in fog or smog during early morning or dusk. The atmosphere is mysterious and slightly cinematic, with muted tones and soft lighting. The background is slightly blurred, and the focus is on the silhouette of the person looking out over the urban landscape. Minimalist composition, dramatic urban mood, inspirational feel.
